# Nightingale

## Building the CSS

1. Ensure youâ€™re on the correct branch and that your copy is up-to-date with the
   work on GitHub.
2. Open Terminal and `cd` to the Nightingale directory:

        $ cd /path/to/nightingale
3. Run the Sass watch command:

        $ npm run watch
   * You might need to trick your machine into rebuilding the CSS for you. To do
     this, open `main.scss` and make any change at all, then save the file.
4. That should be it!
